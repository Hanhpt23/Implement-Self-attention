# Implement-Self-attention
Implementing the self-attention mechanism from scratch can help people better understand the concept of attention.

# This project aims to introduce self-attention. 
The self-attention process involves the following steps:

1. The input for self-attention is a sequence. From this input sequence, we multiply it by three weight matrices: query (Q), key (K), and value (V) to get Q, K and V matrices.

2. We calculate the attention weights by multiplying Q with the transpose of K and then applying a softmax function to the resulting values.

3. The attention is calculated by multiplying the output of the softmax function with the value (V).
